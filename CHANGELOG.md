# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [v0.4.9] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Stale `requested-ref` annotation** — the controller now clears the `stoker.io/requested-ref` annotation once `spec.git.ref` catches up to the value the webhook set (with `v`-prefix normalization so `v2.2.3` matches `2.2.3`); previously the annotation was never removed, permanently overriding `spec.git.ref` and leaving the controller pinned to an old ref whenever a subsequent promotion's webhook failed silently
- **Idempotent webhook returns 202** — the webhook receiver now returns `202 Accepted` (not `200 OK`) when the requested ref is already set; clients using `successExpression: response.status == 202` (e.g. Kargo) no longer treat idempotent calls as failures

## [v0.4.8] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Bearer token auth for webhook receiver** — `webhookReceiver.token` Helm block (parallel to `hmac`); controller reads `WEBHOOK_BEARER_TOKEN` env var and validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; any HTTP client that can set headers can authenticate; if both HMAC and token are configured, either method can authorize a request

## [v0.4.7] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Webhook receiver Ingress** — `webhookReceiver.ingress` block in Helm values; creates an Ingress resource exposing the receiver outside the cluster for push-event-driven syncs from Kargo, GitHub, or other external systems; generic annotations/hosts/tls structure works with any ingress controller (ALB, nginx, Traefik)

## [v0.4.6] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Annotated tag resolution** — `LsRemote` now returns the peeled commit hash (`^{}`) instead of the tag object hash for annotated tags; previously the controller and agent disagreed on the resolved commit, causing an infinite re-sync loop every 30s
- **Root-level file mapping orphan wipe** — `computeManagedRoots` used `filepath.Dir(dst)` for file-type mappings, which collapses to `"."` for root-level destinations (e.g. `.versions.json`); `isUnderManagedRoot` then matched every path, causing orphan cleanup to delete all Ignition runtime files on every sync (internal database, `local` resource collection manifest, OPC-UA keystores) and fault the gateway (#89)

## [v0.4.5] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **`safe.directory` ownership check** — git 2.35.2+ refuses to operate on a repository whose root directory is not owned by the current user; agent pods inherit the Ignition pod's `runAsUser` (e.g. `2003`) but the `/repo` emptyDir mount point is created by Kubernetes as root; fix writes a minimal `.gitconfig` to `/tmp` (which is `$HOME`) with `[safe] directory = *` before any git operation (#87)

## [v0.4.4] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **SSH auth on pods with custom `runAsUser`** — OpenSSH refuses to run when the current UID has no `/etc/passwd` entry; agent pods inherit the Ignition pod's `runAsUser` (e.g. `2003`) which doesn't exist in Alpine's passwd; fix uses an SSH wrapper script in `/tmp` that leverages `nss_wrapper` to inject a minimal passwd entry for the current UID before invoking ssh (#86)

### Changed

- **Agent base image** — added `nss_wrapper` package to `alpine:3.21` image for the SSH passwd fix (#86)

## [v0.4.3] - 2026-02-28

### Changed

- **Native git for agent clone/fetch** — replaced go-git's `CloneOrFetch` with `exec.Command("git", ...)` using `--depth=1` shallow clones; eliminates the OOM kills caused by go-git loading entire pack files into memory during initial clone of large repositories (#85)
- **Agent base image** — replaced `distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` with `alpine:3.21 + git + openssh-client` to provide the native git binary; existing security context (`readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `drop ALL`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`) is unchanged (#85)

### Fixed

- Agent pod OOMKills on large repositories during initial clone (#85)

### Added

- Writable `/tmp` emptyDir injected into agent sidecar pods; native git requires scratch space for lock files and `known_hosts` under `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` (#85)

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **`podAnnotations` and `podLabels`** — Helm values for adding arbitrary annotations and labels to the controller pod (#84)

### Fixed

- **Agent startup probe timeout** — increased `failureThreshold` from 30 → 150 (60s → 5min) to accommodate initial clone of large repositories before the first sync completes (#84)

## [v0.4.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **`{{.PodOrdinal}}` template variable** — StatefulSet replica index sourced from the `apps.kubernetes.io/pod-index` label (K8s 1.27+) with automatic fallback to parsing the trailing integer from the pod name; enables `"{{.GatewayName}}-{{.PodOrdinal}}"` patterns for exact parity with existing systemName conventions (#83)

### Changed

- **Var key validation** — `spec.sync.defaults.vars` and `spec.sync.profiles.*.vars` keys are now validated as Go identifiers (letters, digits, underscores; no dashes) at reconcile time; invalid keys set `ProfilesValid=False` with a clear error message instead of silently failing with a cryptic template parse error at sync time (#83)

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Content templating** (`template: true`) — resolve Go template variables (`{{.GatewayName}}`, `{{.PodName}}`, `{{.Vars.key}}`, etc.) inside file **contents** at sync time, without modifying source files in git; binary files (null bytes) are rejected with a clear error (#82)
- **`vars` in `spec.sync.defaults`** — define default template variables shared across all profiles; profile `vars` override per-key (#82)
- **`{{.PodName}}` in TemplateContext** — enables unique system names for StatefulSet replicas with ordinal-suffix pod names (#82)
- **JSON path patches** — per-mapping `patches` blocks that set specific JSON fields at sync time using sjson dot-notation paths; patch values support Go template syntax; `file` field supports doublestar globs; type inference from filesystem when `type` field is omitted (#82)

### Changed

- **GitHub App tokens moved to dedicated Secret** — installation tokens are now written to `stoker-github-token-{crName}` (a controller-managed Secret) and mounted into agent pods; tokens are no longer stored in the metadata ConfigMap (#82)

### Fixed

- Agent now re-syncs when CR profiles change (new patches, vars, or mappings) even if the git commit has not changed; previously a profile change without a new commit was ignored until the next pod restart (#82)

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed `gateway.apiKeySecretRef`** to `gateway.api.secretName` / `gateway.api.secretKey` — `secretKey` defaults to `"apiKey"` when omitted, reducing boilerplate (#79)
- Gateway port default changed from `8043` to `8088` and TLS default changed from `true` to `false`, matching Ignition Helm chart defaults (#76)
- Webhook receiver disabled by default — enable via `webhookReceiver.enabled: true` in Helm values (#76)

### Added

- **GitHub App authentication** — controller exchanges PEM for short-lived installation tokens with per-CR cache and 5-minute pre-expiry refresh; PEM never leaves controller namespace; supports GitHub Enterprise Server via `apiBaseURL` field (#76)

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Breaking Changes

- **Merged `SyncProfile` into `GatewaySync` CRD** — sync profiles are now embedded at `spec.sync.profiles` instead of a separate CRD; `spec.sync.defaults` provides inheritable baseline settings (#51)
- Removed `deploymentMode` field from sync profile spec (#48)
- Namespace injection label (`stoker.io/injection=enabled`) now optional, disabled by default — injection requires only the `stoker.io/inject: "true"` pod annotation (#64)

### Added

- **Automatic agent RBAC** — controller creates Role/RoleBinding for the agent ServiceAccount in each target namespace (#68)
- **Chainsaw e2e test suite** replacing shell functional tests with declarative Kyverno Chainsaw tests against a real kind cluster (#47, #50)
- **Documentation site** — Docusaurus-based docs with quickstart, guides (multi-gateway, webhook sync, git auth), and CRD reference (#41, #63, #67)

### Fixed

- Controller defers secret validation until after ref resolution, avoiding false errors on public repos (#58)
- Dry-run mode now reports `Synced` status on success instead of staying `Pending` (#59)
- Webhook writes discovered `cr-name` annotation back to pod spec (#60)
- Agent respects profile-level `syncPeriod` from metadata ConfigMap (#61)
- Suppress `NotFound` error log on CR deletion race (#62)

### Changed

- Quickstart: cert-manager moved to prerequisites, added example repo context (#71)
- Cleaned up CI workflow names and e2e trigger strategy (#66)
- Removed stale design docs, scripts, and assets (#70)

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Controller failed to match gateway status from ConfigMap when `stoker.io/gateway-name` annotation was unset, causing gateways to stay `Pending` indefinitely

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Webhook unconditionally mounted a `git-credentials` secret volume even when `spec.git.auth` was nil, causing pods using public repos to get stuck in Init

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

Initial release — controller + agent sidecar for Git-driven Ignition gateway configuration sync.

### Added

- **GatewaySync CRD** (`stoker.io/v1alpha1`) with git ref resolution via `ls-remote`, polling configuration, gateway connection settings, and embedded sync profiles with declarative source-to-destination file mappings, glob patterns, and template variables
- **Sync agent** with 3-layer architecture (syncengine → agent → ignition): clone/fetch, staged file sync with orphan cleanup, Ignition scan API integration
- **Mutating webhook** for automatic sidecar injection into annotated pods (native sidecar pattern, K8s 1.28+)
- **Gateway discovery** via pod annotations with status aggregation from agent ConfigMaps
- **Webhook receiver** (`POST /webhook/{namespace}/{crName}`) with auto-detection of GitHub release, ArgoCD, Kargo, and generic payloads; HMAC signature validation
- **Designer session detection** with configurable policy (`proceed`, `wait`, `fail`)
- **Dry-run mode** per profile for diffing without writing to gateway
- **Pause support** at defaults and per-profile levels
- **Helm chart** with cert-manager TLS, agent RBAC, configurable agent image, and helm-docs generated README
- **CI/CD**: lint, test, and release workflows; multi-arch Docker image builds (amd64/arm64)
- **Functional test suite** with phased kind cluster tests (phases 02-09)
- Unit tests with envtest for controller and syncengine
