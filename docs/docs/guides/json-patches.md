# JSON Patches

JSON patches let the agent surgically update specific fields in JSON files as they are staged — without modifying the source files in git. This is ideal for values that differ per gateway (database hosts, system names, port numbers) when you want precise control over exactly which fields change, rather than treating an entire file as a Go template.

## How it works

Add a `patches` block to any mapping. Each patch specifies:
- **`file`** — which file(s) to patch, expressed as a path relative to the mapping's destination (supports doublestar globs). For file mappings, `file` can be omitted and defaults to the mapped file itself.
- **`set`** — a map of [sjson-style dot-notation paths](https://github.com/tidwall/sjson#path-syntax) to values. Values may contain Go template syntax (the same variables available in `template: true`).

The agent copies files from git into staging, then applies patches in-place before writing to `/ignition-data/`. Source files in git are never modified.

## When to use patches vs `template: true`

| Use case | Best tool |
|----------|-----------|
| Override a few specific JSON field values per gateway | **`patches`** |
| Files authored with `{{...}}` syntax intentionally | **`template: true`** |
| Non-JSON text files with variable placeholders | **`template: true`** |
| Updating database hosts, system names, ports in JSON | **`patches`** |
| Files mix binary and text (images alongside JSON) | **`patches`** on JSON only |

`patches` only works on valid JSON files and will error on anything else — including files that fail JSON parsing. `template: true` works on any text file but requires `{{...}}` syntax to already be in the source.

## Patch value type inference

Patch values are resolved as Go templates first, then type-inferred before being set:

| Value string | Inferred type | Result in JSON |
|---|---|---|
| `"true"` / `"false"` | bool | `true` / `false` |
| `"9090"`, `"3.14"` | number | `9090`, `3.14` |
| `"\"quoted string\""` | string | `"quoted string"` |
| `"my-gateway"` | string (fallback) | `"my-gateway"` |
| `"null"` | null | `null` |

This means you can set boolean flags, numeric ports, and string values without quoting — just write the value you want.

## Examples

### Directory mapping: patch a specific file

Sync a config directory and update the `systemName` field in one JSON file:

```yaml
spec:
  sync:
    profiles:
      default:
        mappings:
          - source: "config/resources/ignition/core"
            destination: "config/resources/ignition/core"
            patches:
              - file: "system-properties/config.json"
                set:
                  systemName: "{{ .GatewayName }}"
```

The source directory `config/resources/ignition/core` is copied as-is from git. After staging, the agent opens `config/resources/ignition/core/system-properties/config.json` and sets `systemName` to the gateway's resolved name.

All other files in the directory are unmodified.

### File mapping: patch the mapped file itself

When the mapping targets a single file, omit `file` and the patch applies to that file:

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: "config/versions/.versions.json"
    destination: "config/versions/.versions.json"
    patches:
      - set:
          gatewayVersion: "{{ .Vars.gatewayVersion }}"
```

:::note
For file mappings, `file` defaults to the base name of the mapped file when omitted. If you specify `file`, it must match the base filename exactly (globs are supported but anchored to the file's parent directory).
:::

### Glob: patch multiple files in a directory

Use a doublestar glob to patch all matching files in a directory mapping:

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: "config/db-connections"
    destination: "config/db-connections"
    patches:
      - file: "*.json"
        set:
          host: "{{ .Vars.dbHost }}"
          port: "{{ .Vars.dbPort }}"
```

Every `.json` file in `config/db-connections/` gets its `host` and `port` fields updated. Non-JSON files (or files in subdirectories not matched by the glob) are untouched.

### Multiple patches on one mapping

A single mapping can carry multiple patch blocks — each targets different files or sets different fields:

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: "config/resources/ignition/core"
    destination: "config/resources/ignition/core"
    patches:
      - file: "system-properties/config.json"
        set:
          systemName: "{{ .GatewayName }}"
          httpPort: "{{ .Vars.gatewayPort }}"
      - file: "redundancy/config.json"
        set:
          masterHostname: "{{ .Vars.masterHost }}"
          backupHostname: "{{ .Vars.backupHost }}"
      - file: "historian-providers/*.json"
        set:
          connection.host: "{{ .Vars.historyDbHost }}"
```

### Patches with `vars`

Combine patches with `spec.sync.defaults.vars` for environment-wide values:

```yaml
spec:
  sync:
    defaults:
      vars:
        dbHost: "postgres.prod.svc.cluster.local"
        dbPort: "5432"
    profiles:
      default:
        mappings:
          - source: "config/db-connections"
            destination: "config/db-connections"
            patches:
              - file: "*.json"
                set:
                  host: "{{ .Vars.dbHost }}"
                  port: "{{ .Vars.dbPort }}"
```

Profile-level `vars` override default `vars` per-key, so you can have a development namespace with different DB hosts while sharing the same profile structure.

## Type inference

:::note
The `type` field in a mapping is optional. When omitted, the agent calls `os.Stat` on the source path at sync time to determine whether it is a file or directory. If you specify `type`, it is validated against the filesystem — a mismatch produces an error. If the source path does not exist and `required: false`, the agent falls back to `"dir"` and skips the mapping silently.
:::

## sjson path syntax

Paths follow [tidwall/sjson](https://github.com/tidwall/sjson#path-syntax) dot-notation:

| Path | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `systemName` | Top-level key |
| `connection.host` | Nested key |
| `networkInterfaces.0.address` | Array element by index |
| `tags.-1` | Append to array |

Paths are case-sensitive. Keys containing `.` or special characters must be escaped — see the sjson docs for details.

## Patches and `template: true` together

`patches` and `template: true` can be set on the same mapping. When both are enabled, `template: true` rendering runs first (resolving `{{...}}` in file contents), then patches are applied. This lets you combine authored template syntax with surgical field overrides on the same files.

```yaml
mappings:
  - source: "config/system-properties"
    destination: "config/resources/local/ignition/system-properties"
    template: true      # resolves {{.GatewayName}} etc. in all text files
    patches:
      - file: "config.json"
        set:
          httpPort: "{{ .Vars.gatewayPort }}"   # also override the port
```

## Error messages

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `file is not valid JSON` | A matched file isn't valid JSON | Patches only work on JSON files; check the glob or `file` field |
| `invalid patch file pattern "<pattern>"` | Malformed doublestar glob | Fix the glob syntax in the `file` field |
| `sjson.Set "<path>": ...` | sjson path error | Check path syntax against the sjson docs |
| `resolving patch value for path "<path>"` | Template error in a `set` value | Check `{{...}}` syntax and that referenced vars exist |
| `type mismatch: spec says "dir" but <path> is a file` | Explicit `type` field doesn't match filesystem | Remove `type` to let it be inferred, or fix the value |
