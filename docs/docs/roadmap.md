# Roadmap

Current version: **v0.4.3** — [see the changelog](https://github.com/ia-eknorr/stoker-operator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## v0.4.x — Content Templating, Config Transforms & Agent Hardening

Multi-site GitOps, surgical config overrides, and production reliability improvements.

- ✅ **Content templating** (`template: true`) — resolve `{{.GatewayName}}`, `{{.PodName}}`, `{{.Vars.key}}`, and all context variables inside file **contents** at sync time; binary files rejected with a clear error
- ✅ **`vars` in `spec.sync.defaults`** — define default template variables shared across all profiles; profile `vars` override per-key
- ✅ **`{{.PodName}}` in TemplateContext** — enables unique system names for StatefulSet replicas
- ✅ **GitHub App tokens → Secret** — installation tokens written to a controller-managed Secret (`stoker-github-token-{crName}`) and mounted into agent pods; no longer stored in ConfigMap
- ✅ **JSON path patches** — per-mapping `patches` blocks that set specific JSON fields at sync time using sjson dot-notation paths; values resolve Go template syntax; `file` field supports doublestar globs; `type` field optional and inferred from filesystem
- ✅ **`{{.PodOrdinal}}` template variable** — StatefulSet replica index from `apps.kubernetes.io/pod-index` label with pod-name fallback; enables `"{{.Vars.projectName}}-{{.PodOrdinal}}"` patterns
- ✅ **Var key validation** — `vars` keys validated as Go identifiers at reconcile time; invalid keys produce a clear `ProfilesValid=False` condition
- ✅ **`podAnnotations` and `podLabels` Helm values** — add arbitrary annotations and labels to the controller pod
- ✅ **Increased agent startup probe timeout** — `failureThreshold` raised to 150 (5 min) to accommodate initial clone of large repositories
- ✅ **Native git for agent clone/fetch** — replaced go-git with `exec.Command("git", ...)` using shallow clones; eliminates OOM kills on large repos
- ✅ **Alpine-based agent image** — replaced distroless with `alpine:3.21 + git + openssh-client`; same security context

## v0.5.0 — Observability & Reliability

Metrics, hardening, and config improvements for production deployments.

- Prometheus metrics for controller (reconcile duration, ref resolution latency, gateway counts, error rates)
- Prometheus metrics for agent (sync duration, files changed, git fetch duration, error counts) with dedicated metrics endpoint
- Grafana dashboard JSON shipped in Helm chart
- SSH host key verification with optional `knownHostsSecretRef` (fix `InsecureIgnoreHostKey`)
- Exponential backoff for transient git and API errors (30s → 60s → 120s → 5m cap)
- Designer session project-level granularity (sync Project B while designer has Project A open)

## v0.6.0 — Scale & Operability

Remove scaling walls and make the agent more reactive.

- Informer-based ConfigMap watch replacing 3s polling in agent
- Downward API annotation reader — enables `stoker.io/ref-override` and profile switching without pod restart
- Per-gateway status ConfigMap sharding (eliminate write contention at 10+ gateways)
- `emptyDir` size limit on agent repo volume (prevent node disk pressure from large repos)
- Webhook receiver rate limiting
- In-flight sync completion deadline on graceful shutdown

## v0.7.0 — Observability & Conditions

Operational visibility for fleet management.

- New condition types: `AgentReady`, `RefSkew`
- Drift detection (re-sync same commit reports unexpected changes)
- Post-sync health verification (project state, tag providers — not just scan 200)
- Sync diff report in changes ConfigMap
- Conflict detection when multiple profiles map to the same destination path
- Validating admission webhook for GatewaySync CRs (reject invalid CRs at apply time)
- Structured audit logging (per-sync JSON record: timestamp, commit, author, gateway, files, result)

## Future Ideas

These are valuable but not yet scoped into versioned milestones. They'll be prioritized based on user feedback.

**Safety & Trust:**
- Pre-sync backup with auto-rollback on scan failure
- Module management (`.modl` sync to `modules/` with `postAction: restart`)
- Per-CR webhook HMAC secrets (replace global HMAC)
- Git commit signature verification (GPG/SSH, IEC 62443 compliance)

**Reach:**
- Standalone agent mode (systemd/Windows service for bare-metal Ignition servers)
- Approval annotation gate for production gateways

**Enterprise:**
- Maintenance windows and change freeze schedules
- External audit sink (SIEM integration via webhook/syslog)
- Drift detection with configurable action (report / restore / alert)
- Resource quotas and rate limiting for concurrent syncs
